# Personal Statement 2 : Describe your most meaningful experience(s) and why they matter to you.

Finding my parents' stash of drugs and uncovering their substance abuse was an event that seemingly broke my understanding of the world. It led me to understand why I was the black sheep of the family (because I held them accountable for their actions) and it forced me to move out of my childhood home. As I became aware of the reasons for my low self esteem, I realized there was no reason to hold myself back from applying myself. True failure would be surrendering to the critical voices of my parents, who were now turned against me. I pushed myself to support myself by taking on roles as a tutor and retail employee, working full time while also in school full time. I struggled a lot with my mental health and did nearly give up on everything several times. I applied to some NASA internships after I began to fall into debt, and I was lucky enough that my mentor took a chance on me despite not having any prior engineering experience. I had to move across the country alone, despite it being my first trip out of state. Nevertheless, it was during this internship that I was able to create a fully-functioning DIY spectrometer with an Arduino, and I began to see my full potential blossom. I believe uncovering my parents' substance abuse was a traumatic event that led me to understand where my negative thought patterns about myself came from, and it enabled me to discover the extent of my work ethic and my drive to succeed.
