I want to make the world a better place both by being compassionate towards others and by improving the technology that improves others' lives. Basically, I want to do what I can with the skills that I have. I've worked as a tutor and as an engineer (well, as an engineering intern!). I've worked in retail and been yelled at by customers during Black Friday and Christmas. I've been an artist and a musician, creating and improving my painting and clarinet skills. I've volunteered with baby animals and with baby humans at shelters and zoos. I've been a friend and a shoulder to cry on. In every job, every volunteering position, every interaction with others, the sense of fulfillment has come through compassion and that assistance to others. Yes, I want to use these technical skills that I've gained, but I want to help others. We gain so much more from extending a helping hand to others than from any technology without that intent behind it.
